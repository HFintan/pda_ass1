This project is the first assignment for the GMIT HDip module Programming for Data Analytics module, due Nov 11th.

The purpose of the project is to practise using Jupyter by expounding on parts of Python's numpy.random manual. More specifically, the tasks are to:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

To open the jupyter notebook, in this directory in the terminal, enter

jupyter notebook my_first_jupyter.ipynb

To run individual (or some selection of) cells, you can use the Cell tab to
choose your preferred option, but we'll aim for a nice notebook setup such
that Run All should be the default.
