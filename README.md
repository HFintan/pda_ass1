This project is the first assignment for the GMIT HDip module Programming for Data Analytics module, due Nov 11th.

The purpose of the project is to gain familiarity with the numpy.random python package, and to practise using Jupyter by expounding on parts of numpy.random manual. More specifically, the tasks are to:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

To open the jupyter notebook, in this directory in the terminal, enter

jupyter notebook my_first_jupyter.ipynb

To run individual (or some selection of) cells, you can use the Cell tab to
choose your preferred option, but we'll aim for a nice notebook setup such
that Run All should be the default.

NOTE: The Run All was working, but after a recent update appears to have
stopped running the code cells properly. My googling leads me to believe
that this is due to a recent browser or adblock update, but I've not been
able to find the fix. I also tried reinstalling anaconda, but time and a
crappy internet connection in this hostel are proving problematic. 
Apologies. I think Running All and then Running All Below the Tnettenba png
works.
